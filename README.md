# Hi there !
## Introduction :runner:
I'm Théo "jenoh" Mémin, a french developer. I'm actually working for [@motion4ever](https://www.motion4ever.com/ ) since March 18th 2019 as a back-end developer. \
\
I mainly use javascript/php to type some code on my machine, but I'm not closed to learn another language as long as I take pleasure.\
